            The grand 75-room D_K Hotel Copenhagen is housed in an historic
            5,400-square-meter landmark building that originally served as the
            Royal Danish Conservatory of Music. Bringing the Nobis magic to the
            midst of the Danish capital, the hotel is starchitect Gert
            Wingardh’s “updated take on Le Corbusier. Danish classicism, which
            this building is a fine example of, is something special—more
            sophisticated, more stripped down than in Sweden, The historic
            landmark building on Niels Brocks Gade has been transformed into a
            cutting-edge contemporary luxury hotel—one where, like its Stockholm
            predecessor, food plays a central role. The restaurant, which takes
            liberty with design status from the 20th-century, borrows from the
            best of Nordic culinary traditions and serves up modern seasonal
            cuisine also traditional culinary from another country, At D_K Hotel
            Copenhagen, modernism meets classicism and it’s all lusciously
            augmented by embracing amenities.

            The months from April to September are the best times to travel to
            Copenhagen. These months make up the city’s spring and summer when
            flowers bloom and there is sunny weather. Copenhagen has a temperate
            maritime climate. Rainy days occur a lot during the year, but there
            is only a small amount of snowfall in winter. Winter is not very
            suitable for sightseeing because there are only 6 hours of sunshine
            in the day which are not bright and it always appears to be dusk. On
            the country in the summer, the nights are short and it is very
            suitable for travel. The historic center of Copenhagen brings
            together the essence of the city. Landmarks such as the Amalienborg
            Palace and Rosenborg are all in this area.

            D_K Hotel Copenhagen is a very nice hotel, close to the train
            station and along the river. Also, very near the Tivoli Gardens,
            This was my second visit and stay at D-K Hotel Copenhagen and having
            stayed here for always. That time we had a one bedroom suite which
            was lovely. A king bedroom on the 7th floor with a river view
            provided "a nice memory of a great view," but it was evening when I
            arrived and still dark when I departed. Lights across the river and
            in the distance still made it a pretty view. The Concierge Club is
            delightful with snacks, water, evening wine and beer. Wine, beer and
            snacks can also be purchased at the Sundry Shop across from
            reception in the lobby. Breakfast was included at my rate along with
            Internet service. Breakfast was delicious, the Internet worked well.
            Copenhagen is a beautiful city. I recommend it to your list of
            places to visit. The D-K Hotel Copenhagen will make your visit very
            comfortable. There is also D_K Hotel in Malmo, Sweden which is
            easily accessible from CPH Airport on the train.
