            The grand 75-room Nobis Hotel Copenhagen is housed in an historic
            5,400-square-meter landmark building that originally served as the
            Royal Danish Conservatory of Music. Bringing the Nobis magic to the
            midst of the Danish capital, the hotel is starchitect Gert
            Wingardh’s “updated take on Le Corbusier. Danish classicism, which
            this building is a fine example of, is something special—more
            sophisticated, more stripped down than in Sweden,” he says. The
            historic landmark building on Niels Brocks Gade has been transformed
            into a cutting-edge contemporary luxury hotel—one where, like its
            Stockholm predecessor, food plays a central role. The restaurant,
            which takes liberty with design styles from the 20th-century,
            borrows from the best of Nordic culinary traditions and serves up
            modern seasonal cuisine. At Nobis Hotel Copenhagen, modernism meets
            classicism and it’s all lusciously augmented by embracing amenities.

            The months from April to September are the best times to travel to
            Copenhagen. These months make up the city’s spring and summer when
            flowers bloom and there is sunny weather. Copenhagen has a temperate
            maritime climate. Rainy days occur a lot during the year, but there
            is only a small amount of snowfall in winter. Winter is not very
            suitable for sightseeing because there are only 6 hours of sunshine
            in the day which are not bright and it always appears to be dusk. On
            the contrary, in the summer, the nights are short and it is very
            suitable for travel. The historic center of Copenhagen brings
            together the essence of the city. Landmarks such as the Amalienborg
            Palace and Rosenborg are all in this area. Many hotels in Copenhagen
            of different grades are distributed in this area, with convenient
            transportation and many choices.

            CPH MARRIOTT Review of Copenhagen Marriott Hotel Reviewed 4 April
            2015 via mobile The Copenhagen Marriott is a very nice hotel, close
            to the rail station and along the river. Also, very near the Tivoli
            Gardens, which first opened in August 1843. This was my second visit
            to the Copenhagen Marriott, having stayed there for the first time
            in December 2013. That time we had a one bedroom suite which was
            lovely. This past time, I was the product of a very late flight
            arrival from Zurich and booked the room the same day. A king bedroom
            on the 7th floor with a river view provided "a nice memory of a
            great view," but it was evening when I arrived and still dark when I
            departed. Lights across the river and in the distance still made it
            a pretty view. The Concierge Club is delightful with snacks, water,
            evening wine and beer. Wine, beer and snacks can also be purchased
            at the Sundry Shop across from reception in the lobby. Breakfast was
            included at my rate along with Internet service. Breakfast was
            delicious, the Internet worked well. Copenhagen is a beautiful city.
            I recommend it to your list of places to visit. The Copenhagen
            Marriott will make your visit very comfortable. Please tell the
            handsome "cow" in the lobby that "Rob PHX said hello." There is also
            a Marriott in Malmo, Sweden which is easily accessible from CPH
            Airport on the train.
